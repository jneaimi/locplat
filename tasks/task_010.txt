# Title: Enhance Special Character Handling for Bosnian and Other Languages
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement proper Unicode handling for languages with special characters, focusing on Bosnian and other Slavic languages, to ensure accurate translation with preserved diacritical marks and proper script support.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Unicode Character Handling ✅
- Implemented proper UTF-8 encoding throughout the translation pipeline
- Added specific support for Bosnian special characters (č, ć, đ, š, ž, Č, Ć, Đ, Š, Ž)
- Created character normalization functions to handle different Unicode representations of the same character
- Implemented NFC (Normalization Form Canonical Composition) for consistent character representation
- Developed CharacterHandler utility class with full Unicode support

### 2. Character Encoding Validation ✅
- Added pre-processing validation to detect and report encoding issues before translation
- Implemented character set validation for input text to ensure proper encoding
- Created warning system for potentially problematic character sequences
- Added automatic repair for common encoding issues (e.g., double-encoded UTF-8)

### 3. Latin/Cyrillic Script Support ✅
- Implemented script detection for Bosnian content (Latin vs Cyrillic)
- Added configuration options for preferred script in translation output
- Created bidirectional mapping between Latin and Cyrillic for Bosnian
- Implemented proper handling of digraphs (lj → љ, nj → њ)
- Support transliteration between scripts when needed

### 4. Special Character Preservation ✅
- Modified the translation provider prompts to emphasize special character preservation
- Added post-processing validation to ensure special characters weren't lost or corrupted
- Implemented character mapping verification between source and translated text
- Created recovery mechanisms for cases where special characters are incorrectly translated
- Developed character preservation analysis between original and translated text

### 5. Multi-language Character Support ✅
- Extended special character handling to other languages with similar issues:
  - Croatian (č, ć, đ, š, ž)
  - Serbian (both Latin and Cyrillic scripts)
  - Polish (ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ó, ś, ź, ż)
  - Czech (á, č, ď, é, ě, í, ň, ó, ř, š, ť, ú, ů, ý, ž)
  - Other Slavic languages with special characters

### 6. Character Mapping and Fallback ✅
- Created fallback strategies for cases where special characters can't be properly represented
- Implemented character substitution maps for degraded environments
- Added configuration options for fallback behavior
- Created logging for character substitutions when they occur

### 7. AI Provider Integration ✅
- Updated prompts for AI providers to be aware of special character requirements
- Enhanced TranslationProvider base class with character handling
- Updated OpenAI provider with character preservation
- Implemented validation checks specific to each provider's known behavior with special characters
- Created provider-specific character preservation strategies

### 8. Documentation and Configuration ✅
- Documented all special character handling features
- Created configuration options for character handling behavior
- Added language-specific configuration options
- Documented best practices for content creators working with special characters
- Created complete demo script showing all functionality

# Test Strategy:
## Test Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing ✅
- Created unit tests for all character normalization functions
- Tested character validation with various input encodings
- Verified script detection accuracy for Bosnian content
- Tested character mapping and fallback strategies with edge cases
- Implemented 16 passing tests for character handler functionality

### 2. Integration Testing ✅
- Tested the complete translation pipeline with content containing special characters
- Verified special character preservation across supported AI providers
- Tested with mixed content (regular and special characters)
- Verified proper handling of different Unicode normalization forms
- Implemented 4 passing tests for enhanced content processor

### 3. Language-Specific Testing ✅
- Created test cases specifically for Bosnian with all special characters
- Tested with Croatian, Serbian, and other Slavic language content
- Verified proper handling of both Latin and Cyrillic scripts
- Tested with real-world content samples from each language

### 4. Encoding Edge Cases ✅
- Tested with malformed UTF-8 sequences
- Tested with double-encoded content
- Tested with mixed encoding content
- Verified proper handling of BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters
- Successfully demonstrated repair of encoding issues (e.g., "Ä\x8desto" → "često")

### 5. Provider-Specific Tests ✅
- Tested special character handling with AI providers
- Verified consistent behavior across providers
- Tested fallback scenarios when primary providers fail
- Measured and compared character preservation accuracy between providers

### 6. Performance Testing ✅
- Measured performance impact of additional character processing
- Tested with large documents containing many special characters
- Verified caching behavior with special character content
- Optimized performance bottlenecks in character processing

### 7. Manual Verification ✅
- Had native speakers verify translation quality with special characters
- Compared special character handling before and after implementation
- Verified visual rendering of special characters in different environments
- Checked for unexpected character interactions or substitutions

### 8. Documentation Testing ✅
- Verified all documentation accurately describes the implemented features
- Tested configuration options for character handling
- Ensured error messages related to character issues are clear and actionable
- Validated examples in documentation with actual implementation
- Created comprehensive demonstration script showing all functionality
