# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix Exception Chaining Issues (Critical Security) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix all exception chaining issues across provider implementations to prevent information leakage and improve debugging. Add 'from e' to all exception raises where original exceptions are wrapped.
### Details:
Files to fix:
- app/services/openai_provider.py (lines 52-59, 88)
- app/services/anthropic_provider.py (lines 46-53, 81)
- app/services/mistral_provider.py (lines 70-73, 101)
- app/services/deepseek_provider.py (lines 71-73, 91)
- app/api/translation.py (lines 121-123, 160-162, 193, 211, 231)

Change pattern from:
raise ProviderError(self.name, f"Error: {str(e)}", e)

To:
raise ProviderError(self.name, f"Error: {str(e)}", e) from e

## 2. Implement Input Sanitization (Critical Security) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement input sanitization to prevent prompt injection attacks and token limit exceeded errors. Add length limits, control character stripping, and safe text handling.
### Details:
Critical security vulnerability in app/services/translation_provider.py lines 166-184:

Current unsafe code:
```python
prompt += f"\n\nText to translate: {text}"
```

Implement:
1. MAX_CHARS = 2000 limit for text and context
2. Strip control characters and potential injection strings
3. Truncate user input before embedding in prompts
4. Validate text content for safety

Add method:
```python
def _sanitize_text(self, text: str, max_chars: int = 2000) -> str:
    # Remove control chars, truncate, escape dangerous patterns
    safe_text = text[:max_chars]
    safe_text = re.sub(r'[\x00-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x7f-\x9f]', '', safe_text)
    return safe_text.strip()
```

## 3. Fix CORS Security Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix CORS security configuration and tighten production security settings. Replace wildcard origins with environment-specific allowed domains.
### Details:
Security issue in app/main.py lines 31-35:

Current unsafe configuration:
```python
allow_origins=["*"]  # ❌ Too permissive
```

Fix by:
1. Create environment-specific CORS settings in app/config.py
2. Add CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS to settings with default secure values
3. Update main.py to use environment-controlled origins

Recommended implementation:
```python
# In config.py
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",  # Development
    "https://yourdomain.com", # Production
    "https://admin.yourdomain.com"
]

# In main.py
add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=settings.CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## 4. Code Hygiene and Formatting Cleanup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clean up code hygiene issues: remove trailing whitespace, fix unused imports, wrap long lines, and improve code formatting across all files.
### Details:
Code hygiene issues identified by CodeRabbit:

1. Trailing whitespace (28+ locations):
   - app/services/openai_provider.py (lines 13, 20, 22-25, 33, 46, 51, 60, 62-65, 72, 78, 89, 104, 108)
   - app/services/anthropic_provider.py (lines 13, 20, 22-25, 33, 40, 45, 54, 56-59, 66, 71, 82, 97, 101)
   - app/services/mistral_provider.py (similar pattern)
   - app/services/translation_provider.py (similar pattern)
   - tests/test_translation_providers.py (similar pattern)

2. Unused imports to remove:
   - app/api/translation.py: Remove unused `Depends` and `LanguageDirection`
   - app/services/flexible_translation_service.py: Remove `asyncio`, `Tuple`, `TranslationProvider`
   - tests/test_translation_providers.py: Remove `asyncio`, `patch`, `TranslationError`, `ProviderError`

3. Long lines to wrap (>100 chars):
   - Multiple files have lines exceeding 100 character limit

Automated fix commands:
```bash
# Remove trailing whitespace
find . -name "*.py" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} \;

# Use ruff to auto-fix imports
ruff check --fix app/ tests/
```

## 5. Performance Optimizations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize performance by implementing concurrent quality assessment and fixing shallow copy issues in collection translation.
### Details:
Performance optimizations needed:

1. Sequential Quality Assessment Issue (app/services/flexible_translation_service.py:205-209):
   Current inefficient code:
   ```python
   for i, (original, translated) in enumerate(zip(texts, translated_texts)):
       quality_score = await translation_provider.assess_translation_quality(...)
   ```

   Fix with concurrent execution:
   ```python
   quality_tasks = [
       translation_provider.assess_translation_quality(orig, trans, source_lang, target_lang)
       for orig, trans in zip(texts, translated_texts)
   ]
   quality_scores = await asyncio.gather(*quality_tasks)
   ```

2. Shallow Copy Issue (app/services/flexible_translation_service.py:311):
   Current unsafe code:
   ```python
   translated_data = collection_data.copy()  # ❌ Shallow copy
   ```

   Fix with deep copy:
   ```python
   import copy
   translated_data = copy.deepcopy(collection_data)  # ✅ Deep copy
   ```

3. Make assess_translation_quality synchronous:
   Remove unnecessary async from method that does no I/O operations

## 6. Refactor Provider Architecture (Code Deduplication) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor provider implementations to reduce code duplication by extracting common functionality into a base provider class.
### Details:
Code duplication issue identified by CodeRabbit:

Current problem: OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and DeepSeek providers share significant duplicate code:
- Same structure and error handling patterns
- Identical batch_translate implementations
- Similar validate_api_key methods
- Repeated exception handling

Recommended solution:
Create BaseAsyncProvider class with common functionality:

```python
class BaseAsyncProvider(TranslationProvider):
    """Base class for async translation providers with common functionality."""
    
    async def batch_translate(self, texts, source_lang, target_lang, api_key, context=None):
        """Common batch translation implementation."""
        if not texts:
            return []
        
        tasks = [
            self.translate(text, source_lang, target_lang, api_key, context)
            for text in texts
        ]
        
        try:
            results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
            translations = []
            for result in results:
                if isinstance(result, Exception):
                    raise result
                translations.append(result)
            return translations
        except Exception as e:
            raise ProviderError(self.name, f"Batch translation failed: {str(e)}", e) from e
```

This would eliminate duplicate code across all providers and make maintenance easier.

## 7. Improve Exception Handling Specificity [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve exception handling specificity by replacing broad Exception catches with specific exception types in provider validation methods.
### Details:
Issue: Multiple providers catch broad Exception types in validation methods, which can mask unexpected errors.

Files to fix:
1. app/services/openai_provider.py (lines 100-103):
   ```python
   # ❌ Current
   except openai.AuthenticationError:
       return False
   except Exception:  # Too broad
       return False
   
   # ✅ Should be
   except openai.AuthenticationError:
       return False
   except (openai.APIError, openai.RateLimitError, openai.APIConnectionError):
       return False
   ```

2. app/services/anthropic_provider.py (lines 93-96):
   Similar fix needed for Anthropic-specific exceptions

3. app/services/mistral_provider.py and deepseek_provider.py:
   Replace generic Exception with specific HTTP and API errors

Benefits:
- Better error visibility and debugging
- More precise error handling
- Prevents masking of unexpected errors
- Follows Python best practices for exception handling

Each provider should catch only the specific exceptions it expects during validation.
