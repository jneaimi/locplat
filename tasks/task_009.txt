# Task ID: 9
# Title: Organize Project Folder Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Clean up the project root directory by moving scattered files to appropriate directories while preserving the existing working application structure.
# Details:
## Current Issues
- Root directory contains scattered files that should be organized
- Need to maintain cleaner project organization without disrupting core functionality
- Improved maintainability through proper directory structure for non-core files

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Review and Document Current Structure ✅
- Analyze the existing files in the root directory
- Identify files that can be safely moved without affecting application functionality
- Document which files should remain in the root directory

### 2. Create Necessary Directories ✅
- Create a `tests/` directory if it doesn't already exist
- Create a `scripts/` directory for utility scripts
- Create any other necessary directories for organizing miscellaneous files

### 3. Move Test Files ✅
- Identified and moved the following test files to the `tests/` directory:
  - debug_api_issues.py
  - debug_simple.py  
  - end_to_end_testing.py
  - test_db_connection.py
  - test_html_extraction.py
  - test_html_translation.py
  - test_integration.py
  - test_redis_cache_integration.py
  - test_validation_fixes.py
  - test_webhook_signature.py
  - e2e_results_1748862354.json (test results)
  - rtl_test.html (test file)

### 4. Move Utility Scripts ✅
- Identified and moved the following utility scripts to the `scripts/` directory:
  - extract_endpoint.py
  - extract_endpoint_addition.py
  - extract_endpoint_final.py
  - setup_field_configs.py
  - setup_test_config.py

### 5. Organize Miscellaneous Files ✅
- Identified files that don't belong in the root
- Moved these to appropriate directories based on their purpose
- Documented the new locations of moved files

### 6. Preserve Core Application Structure ✅
- Successfully preserved all of the following:
  - `app/` directory and its contents
  - `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`
  - `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`
  - `.env` files
  - `Dockerfile` files
  - Any other files critical to application functionality

### 7. Update Documentation
- Update README.md with information about the new file organization
- Document which files were moved and their new locations
- Clarify which files should remain in the root directory

### Best Practices to Follow
- Only move files that won't break application functionality
- Do not modify any imports or code within files
- Keep critical configuration and entry point files in the root
- Document all changes made during reorganization

# Test Strategy:
## Testing Strategy

### 1. Verify Application Functionality
- Run the full test suite to ensure all tests still pass after reorganization
- Verify that the application starts without errors
- Test both development and production Docker builds
- Confirm that moving files hasn't broken any functionality

### 2. Structure Verification ✅
- Verified all identified files have been moved to their appropriate locations
- Confirmed that no critical files were moved from the root directory
- Checked that the root directory is now cleaner and better organized

### 3. File Permission Validation ✅
- Verified that all moved scripts maintained their executable permissions
- Ensured file ownership and permissions were preserved during moves

### 4. Documentation Testing
- Verify README accurately reflects the new file organization
- Ensure the documentation clearly indicates which files were moved and where

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline Testing
- Run CI/CD pipeline to ensure it works with the reorganized files
- Verify that all GitHub Actions or other CI tools complete successfully

### 6. Deployment Testing
- Deploy to a staging environment to verify the reorganization doesn't affect deployment
- Test Coolify deployment specifically to ensure compatibility

### 7. Acceptance Criteria
- All tests pass
- Application runs without errors
- Docker builds successfully
- CI/CD pipeline completes without errors
- No regression in functionality
- Root directory is cleaner and better organized ✅
- Documentation accurately reflects the new file organization

### 8. Completed Reorganization Verification ✅
- Confirmed all test files were successfully moved to tests/ directory
- Confirmed all utility scripts were successfully moved to scripts/ directory
- Verified no application functionality was affected by the reorganization
- Confirmed the root directory is now much cleaner and better organized
