# Coolify Automatic Domain Configuration (Simplified)

## You're Right - Coolify Should Handle Everything!

Coolify's built-in reverse proxy (Caddy) should automatically:
- ✅ Generate SSL certificates
- ✅ Configure reverse proxy 
- ✅ Handle domain routing
- ✅ Set up HTTPS

## Simplified Steps:

### 1. In Coolify Dashboard Only:
1. **Go to your LocPlat service**
2. **Find "Domains" or "URLs" section**
3. **Add domain: `locplat.estatfinder.com`**
4. **Save - Coolify handles the rest automatically**

### 2. Optional Environment Variable:
```env
DOMAIN_NAME=locplat.estatfinder.com
```
(Only if you want to reference it in your app)

### 3. That's It!
Coolify should automatically:
- Generate Let's Encrypt certificate
- Configure Caddy reverse proxy
- Route domain to your service on port 8090
- Handle HTTPS termination

## Why It Might Not Be Working:

1. **Check if domain was added properly in Coolify**
2. **Verify SSL certificate generation status**
3. **Check Coolify proxy logs for errors**

## Quick Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check Coolify proxy status
docker logs coolify-proxy | grep locplat

# Check if your service is properly registered
docker exec coolify-proxy caddy list-configs | grep locplat

# Verify certificate generation
docker exec coolify-proxy ls /data/caddy/certificates/ | grep estatfinder
```

## Expected Behavior:
After adding domain in Coolify → Wait 2-3 minutes → Domain should work with HTTPS

If it's not working automatically, there might be a Coolify configuration issue or the domain addition didn't register properly.
