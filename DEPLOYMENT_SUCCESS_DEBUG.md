# Coolify Deployment Success - Port Configuration Fix

## ✅ SUCCESS: Deployment is Working!
Your containers are now running successfully:
- ✅ PostgreSQL: Healthy
- ✅ Redis: Healthy  
- ✅ API: Started
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ Used docker-compose.coolify.yml correctly

## Issue: Port Not Reflecting Changes

### Problem:
You changed the port in Coolify but it's still not using the new value.

### Root Cause:
The `.env` file in the deployment directory may still have the old port value.

### Solutions:

#### Option 1: Force Environment Variable in Coolify
In Coolify service settings, make sure you set:
```env
API_PORT=8080
```
**Important**: Check if there's a separate "Environment Variables" section vs "Build Environment Variables"

#### Option 2: Check Current Port
Run this command in Coolify terminal or your server:
```bash
docker ps | grep api
```
This will show which port the API container is actually using.

#### Option 3: Verify Environment Loading
Check if the environment variable is being read:
```bash
docker exec <api-container-name> env | grep API_PORT
```

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check actual port mapping:**
   ```bash
   docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}"
   ```

2. **Check container logs:**
   ```bash
   docker logs <api-container-name>
   ```

3. **Test connectivity:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

### Access Your Application:

Once you identify the correct port, access your app at:
- `http://your-server-ip:PORT/`
- `http://your-server-ip:PORT/docs` (API documentation)
- `http://your-server-ip:PORT/health` (Health check)

### Next Steps:
1. Find the actual port being used
2. Update Coolify domain/proxy settings if needed
3. Test API endpoints
